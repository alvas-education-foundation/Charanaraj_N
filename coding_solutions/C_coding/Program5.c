PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Write a C Program to implement various operations of Singly Linked List Stack
Hint:
First Create a Singly Linked List Stack with the node corresponding to First Element is the base of the stack; and its link field must be always Null.
When you push First Element, It is the First and it is Base of the stack. Its Link must be Null. top pointer pointing to First. (top = First)
When you push any element, (No need of checking Stack full case because SLL is dynamic) Create a new node called temp using malloc function and insert the a number into Data field, and Link field must be pointing to top; and move the pointer top to point to temp.
When you pop, First check for stack Empty. if First == NULL, then Stack Empty. If it is not empty, The pointer temp must be pointing to top. Move the pointer top to top->link. delete temp.
When you display the stack element, First Check for Stack Empty as in pop operation. If it is not empty, Display all the elements of current stack starting from top to First.

SOLUTION:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#define TRUE 1
#define FALSE 0

struct node
{
    int data;
    struct node *next;
};
typedef struct node node;

node *top;

void initialize()
{
    top = NULL;
}

void push(int value)
{
    node *tmp;
    tmp = malloc(sizeof(node));
    tmp -> data = value;
    tmp -> next = top;
    top = tmp;
}

int pop()
{
    node *tmp;
    int n;
    tmp = top;
    n = tmp->data;
    top = top->next;
    free(tmp);
    return n;
}

int Top()
{
    return top->data;
}

int isempty()
{
    return top==NULL;
}

void display(node *head)
{
    if(head == NULL)
    {
        printf("NULL\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("%d\n", head -> data);
        display(head->next);
    }
}

int main()
{
    initialize();
    push(10);
    push(20);
    push(30);
    printf("The top is %d\n",Top());
    pop();
    printf("The top after pop is %d\n",Top());
    display(top);
    return 0;
